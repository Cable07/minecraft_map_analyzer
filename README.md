# minecraft_map_analyzer
The idea is to create a script that will analyze a Minecraft map and output readable data on all that information (ie. structure locations, number of any given block within a specified region, height maps, biome distribution)

NOTE: As of now, the script is fully unfinished and has very little (if any) utility
